# Lesson Learned

## Module 1-3
Previously, I have learned about web development in my University. However, during this course (module 1-3), I learned new things about HTML that I didn't know before. Some new things that I learned during this course on module 1-3 are:

1. Learned some new HTML elements and attributes.
2. Learned that `creating a basic HTML template before giving any styling` is easier than `creating HTML and giving styling at the same time`.
