# Project Description
Module 1-5 is about creating a simple blog-like website. Here, the course will explain the basics of HTML and CSS. In this repository, module 1-5 is divided into 2 branches `module-1-3` that focus on HTML and `module-4-5-styling` that focus on CSS. Later, on module 6-8, the course will teach about Javascript and web storage in a completely different project (instead of blog-like website, it will be a calculator). Module 6-8 will be divided into 2 branches `module-6-7-flexbox-javascript` and `module-8-web-storage`.
